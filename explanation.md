# Explanation for video:
Video showcases my program, with simple goal of sorting and reverse sorting an inputted array. 

Demo shows off all the branches that exist, show making a basic change and that change showing up on master.

We also verified that these changes ended up and master, and showed off my simple unit tests.

Unit tests check that the sorting works in both directions, and that the program is able to interpret user input correctly.
